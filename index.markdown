### Welcome!

This website collects resources and information on the NÃ©gritude movement, an anti-colonial cultural and political movement founded in Paris in the 1930s. The movement, developed mainly by francophone intellectuals, writers, and politicians of the African diaspora, aimed at cultivating and promoting Black art, culture, and consciousness as a form of resistance against colonialism and racism.

We invite you to explore the site to learn more about this important historical movement.

The site was designed by UT-Austin Global Studies GRA Jyotsna Vempati. The content was written and researched by [Ian Goodale, European Studies Librarian at the University of Texas at Austin](https://guides.lib.utexas.edu/prf.php?account_id=95907).
